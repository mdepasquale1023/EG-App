## Data Origin:

	Data was gathered from Subsplash: Analytics

## Definitions:

1. Downloads: This refers to the total number of times the app has been downloaded by users. Each download represents a new user acquiring the app, which is a crucial metric for understanding the app's reach. 

2. Launches: A launch is counted every time a user opens your app. This metric is vital for gauging user retention and engagement. Frequent launches indicate that users find value in the app and choose to return to it repeatedly. 

3. Impressions (Page Views): Impressions are defined as the number of times users access individual pages within the app. This is a bit unique compared to the more common definition of impressions, which often refers to views of an advertisement or listing. Here, impressions give insight into how users interact with the app's content. High page views suggest that users are actively exploring the app, which is indicative of strong user engagement and interest in the content offered.

## Key Performance Metrics:

The data has been transformed in Python to calculate additional metrics in order to gauge the effectiveness of the app.

1. Average Downloads: the average number of times the app was downloaded per month. 

2. Average Launches: the average number of times the app was opened each month.

3. Average Page Views (Impressions): this metric shows how many times users interacted with individual pages within the app. High page views indicate that users are actively exploring the app, suggesting engaging content and a good user experience.

4. Average Page Views per Launch: this metric indicates the number of pages a user views on average each time they open the app. It provides insight into how deeply users are engaging with the app during each session. The higher the number, the more engaged the users are.

5. Average Conversion Rate Launches to Page Views (%): This rate represents the ratio of page views to app launches, multiplied by 100 to express it as a percentage. It indicates the level of user engagement within the app. Despite appearing over 100%, it's normal in this context, as users can view multiple pages per single app launch, demonstrating the app's ability to engage users effectively.

## Summary Statistics:

- Average Monthly Figures:
- Downloads: ~89.5
- Launches: ~1670.4
- Impressions: ~9641.5
- Trend Analysis (Month-over-Month Change):
	- Downloads: Decreased by an average of ~1.98%
	- Launches: Decreased by an average of ~0.84%
	- Impressions: Decreased by an average of ~2.37%
	- Conversion Rates:

- Impressions to Downloads: On average, ~0.98% of impressions convert to downloads.
Downloads to Launches: On average, each download leads to approximately 1932.8 launches. This high number suggests users are very engaged with the app, or it might indicate a data inconsistency, especially if it's unrealistic for each download to result in that many launches.

This overview provides a snapshot of the app's performance, showing a slight downward trend in downloads, launches, and impressions over the months. The conversion rates highlight areas of strength and potential improvement, particularly in turning impressions into downloads.

## General Trends:

The data shows that the app has an average of about 89.5 downloads per month. This indicates a consistent interest from new users. The app isn't just sitting unused on users' devices; it's being opened frequently, with an average of 1670.4 launches per month. Furthermore, users are not just opening the app; they're engaging with it, shown by an average of 9641.5 page views (impressions) per month.Our app has been consistently gaining traction, with a certain number of downloads each month. Users aren't just downloading the app; they're actively using it, as shown by the number of times they launch it and interact with various pages within the app.

## User Engagement:

On average, there are about 5.57 page views per launch. This metric suggests that once users open the app, they don't just look at one page and leave; they browse through about 5 to 6 pages each time. This level of engagement is a positive sign that users find the app's content compelling and valuable, prompting them to explore more than just the landing page or the initial screen they encounter.

Month-Over-Month Changes:
While the average figures provide a snapshot, the month-over-month changes reveal the dynamics over time. For example, if you notice a particular month where downloads spiked or dropped significantly, it could indicate the impact of marketing campaigns, seasonality, or changes in user preferences. Similarly, fluctuations in launches and page views can help identify when users became more or less active and what content or features might be influencing these changes. These trends are crucial for understanding not just the static picture but how the app's usage evolves over time.

Why is the average page views per launch trending downward?
There is a trend where, on average, users are viewing fewer pages each time they launch the app. This might indicate a shift in how our users are engaging with the app.

## Possible Implications: 

This could suggest that users are finding what they need more quickly, which isn't necessarily negative. However, it might also mean that they are less engaged with the content, which is an area that should be investigated.
To better understand this trend, we can look into more detailed user behavior analytics, gather user feedback, and possibly identify specific areas or content within the app that aren't meeting user expectations. Understanding the 'why' behind this trend is crucial for us to make targeted improvements.
Based on our findings, we can develop strategies to enhance user engagement, whether it's through updating existing content, adding new features, or improving app usability.

## Recommendations:

Enhance User Engagement: Given the average page views per launch, there's room to deepen user engagement. Consider enhancing the app's content or introducing new features that encourage users to explore more pages per session. User feedback can be invaluable in identifying what features or content users would like to see.
Monitor and Address the Downtrend: If the average page views per launch are trending downward, it's crucial to investigate why users are engaging less with the app. Conduct anonymous user surveys, analyze user behavior, and gather feedback to understand the factors contributing to this trend and address them.

Optimize Onboarding: Ensure that new users understand the app's value and features from the get-go. An intuitive and engaging onboarding process can increase the likelihood of new users becoming regular users, which can positively impact both launches and page views. A technology ambassador can be a volunteer role (imagine the Apple Genius at the Apple Store or the Geek Squad at Best Buy). Seminars can be conducted to get the most out of the app (especially considering the older demographic in the congregation).

Personalization and Customization: Implement features that allow users to tailor their experience within the app. Personalization can increase user engagement by providing more relevant content, which could potentially increase the number of page views per launch. Depending on Subsplash functionality, this can be something like a profile picture or a daily status of some sorts (that ought to be restricted to something like what is your favorite Bible verse

Content Refreshment and Updates: Regularly update the app's content to keep it fresh and engaging. New content can attract users to launch the app more frequently and explore more pages during each session. Enabling push notifications can entice users, or a daily check-in to view something like the verse of the day.

Marketing and User Acquisition Strategies: While the focus on engagement and retention is crucial, don't neglect user acquisition. Analyze the channels through which new users are discovering the app and optimize your marketing strategies to increase downloads. This is a unique issue since this is often for congregants, but there are ways to make this more region specific. 
Data-Driven Enhancements: Continue to monitor these metrics and use them to guide the app's future. Data-driven decisions can help you prioritize features or content that resonates with your users, improving user satisfaction and engagement.
